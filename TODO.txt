TODO:
	Write code to create rpl-c binary code, batten on to the executable a runtime program.
	Implement new/clr stuff for that program.
	Check code runs.
	Implement calls/return code
	Implement variables
	Add export as you go
	When the core is written, write the importers and scanners.
	
Missing vocabulary:	
	; << <= <> >= >> alloc assert clr vlist
	else end endif for if index list load new 
	next old repeat rnd run save sgn stop until	
	(old will have to use the listing code to advance the pointer)	

Fixes:
	On NextLine if (IP) = 0 then goto end. There is no nextline. Currently errors.
