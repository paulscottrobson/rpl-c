TODO:
	Implement begin/end
	Implement calls/return code
	Implement variables
	Implement other structures.
	Add export as you go
	When the core is written, write the importers and scanners.
	
Missing vocabulary:	
	; << <= <> >= >> alloc assert vlist
	else endif for if index list load 
	next old repeat rnd run save sgn until	
	(old will have to use the listing code to advance the pointer)	

Fixes:
