TODO:
	Implement variable creation.
	Implement other structures.
	Implement other words
	Write "List" code (keep a skipper for OLD)
	When the core is written, write the importers and scanners.
	
Missing vocabulary:	
	$$@handler $$!handler
	alloc vlist
	else endif for if index list load 
	next old run save	
	(old will have to use the listing code to advance the pointer)	

Encoders/Immediate:
	repeat	until

Decoders:
	$$call 	$$comment $$string $$@handler $$!handler

Fixes:
	Optimise the call lookup.
