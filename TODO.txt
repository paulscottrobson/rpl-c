TODO:

	when encoding it truncating it to 64 chars. Very long (80+) lines give a syntax error.

	Escape/Stack check.
	Add [] indexing handler
	Implement old
		
Missing vocabulary:	
	old

Encoders/Immediate:
	(None)

Decoders:
	(None)

Fixes:

	Optimise the call lookup.
	AdvanceFreeMem checks high memory for out of memory.
