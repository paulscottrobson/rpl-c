TODO:
	Line editing.
	- :x doesn't encode ? haven't written it- should allow . in the name

	Error handling
	Empty REM lists as yellow blocks (?)
	Encoders for structures (change generation to be legit)	
	Escape/Stack check.
	Add [x] indexing handler (?)
	Add [] indexing handler
	Implement other words
		
Missing vocabulary:	
	load save old

Encoders/Immediate:
	repeat	until 
	for 	next
	if 		else 	endif

Decoders:
	(None)

Fixes:
	Optimise the call lookup.
	AdvanceFreeMem checks high memory for out of memory.
	Seperate type for $constants ?
	How do we do escape/check stack ? Interrupt hack ? Patched IP which also tests S ?
