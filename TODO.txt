TODO:
	Do we need importers or are they all special cases. Some are immediate (bit 7)
		NO: Because they've been identified uniquely to get that far, so they'll be immediate.
			Replace Encode address with immediate flag.
			
	Write code to create rpl-c binary code, batten on to the executable a runtime program.
	Implement new/clr stuff for that program.
	Check code runs.
	Implement calls/return code
	Implement variables
	Add export as you go
	When the core is written, write the importers and scanners.
	
Missing vocabulary:	
; << <= <> >= >> alloc assert clr vlist
else end endif for if index list load new 
next old repeat rnd run save sgn stop until	

Fixes:
	On NextLine if (IP) = 0 then goto end. There is no nextline.
